# Pre-Built

### This is not done yet! I might finish this tomorrow

Alright, alright, so you just wanna use a pre-built version instead of making it yourself don't you?

That's alright! I got you covered!

At the releases page, search for "Pre-Built" and download it, also it's a real big chungus, unmodified version of Big Sur, so if you really want to do it, it's YOUR risk

After waiting 15 hours for the download to finish, login with account "prebuilt" with the safest password ever "prebuilt"

Why?
